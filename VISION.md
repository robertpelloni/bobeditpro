# Vision: Audacity 4 (The Audition Killer)

**Goal:** Create the definitive open-source professional audio workstation, achieving complete feature parity with Adobe Audition (and Cool Edit Pro legacy).

## Key Pillars

1.  **Professional UI (BobUI):** A dark, dense, high-performance UI toolkit built on a custom Qt fork.
2.  **Destructive & Non-Destructive:** The unique ability to switch between destructive waveform editing (for surgical repair) and non-destructive multitrack mixing.
3.  **Spectral Power:** Industry-leading spectral editing tools (Spot Healing, Noise Print, Lasso).
4.  **Routing & Mixing:** A flexible routing architecture with Busses, Aux Sends, and Side-chains.

## Architecture
- **Monorepo:** Contains all dependencies (BobUI, Muse Framework).
- **Au3 Libraries:** Modular C++ backend.
- **QML Frontend:** Modern, fluid interface.

**"Don't Stop."**
