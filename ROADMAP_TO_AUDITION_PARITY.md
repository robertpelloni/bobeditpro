# Roadmap to Audacity <> Adobe Audition Parity

This roadmap outlines the strategic phases required to bring Audacity to feature parity with Adobe Audition (and its predecessor, Cool Edit Pro). The goal is to evolve Audacity from a destructive waveform editor into a professional-grade, non-destructive Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) while retaining its accessibility.

## Phase 1: The Core Foundation (Architecture & Workflow)
*Focus: Bridging the gap between "Editor" and "DAW".*

### 1.1 Non-Destructive Waveform Editing
**Status: In Progress / Experimental**
**Current State**: Audacity is primarily destructive in Waveform view. Multitrack view has clips, but edits within them are often destructive or limited.
**Goal**: All edits (cuts, fades, effects) should be non-destructive by default.
*   **Virtual Clips**: Implement a robust "Clip" architecture where the underlying audio file is never touched. (Initial implementation via `NonDestructiveEditing` pref).
*   **Clip Layers**: Allow stacking clips/takes on a single track (Comping).
*   **Undo History Persistence**: Save undo history with the project file (like Audition's "History" panel).

### 1.2 Enhanced Real-Time Effects Rack
**Status: Foundation Laid**
**Current State**: Audacity 3.2+ has real-time effects, but the UI and routing are basic compared to Audition's Rack.
**Goal**: A fully featured, automatable Effects Rack.
*   **Pre/Post Fader Slots**: Allow placing effects before or after the volume fader.
*   **Clip-Level Effects**: Apply real-time effects to individual clips, not just tracks. (Infrastructure added in `WaveClipRealtimeEffects`).
*   **Sidechaining**: Support sidechain inputs for compressors/gates.
*   **Effect Chain Presets**: Save/load entire chains of effects.

### 1.3 Professional Multitrack Mixing
**Current State**: Basic volume/pan sliders on tracks. Mixer board is separate and limited.
**Goal**: A unified Mixer View with bussing and routing.
*   **Bussing**: Create "Bus Tracks" (Aux tracks) for grouping audio (e.g., Drum Bus).
*   **Routing Matrix**: Flexible input/output routing for tracks.
*   **Automation Lanes**: Dedicated lanes for automating volume, pan, and *any* effect parameter (Read/Write/Latch/Touch modes).

## Phase 2: The "Cool" Restoration & Analysis
*Focus: Matching Cool Edit Pro's legendary analysis and restoration tools.*

### 2.1 Spectral Editing Evolution
**Current State**: Basic spectral selection and deletion.
**Goal**: "Photoshop for Audio".
*   **Spectral Spot Healing Brush**: "Paint" over noises to remove them using surrounding frequencies.
*   **Lasso Selection**: Free-form selection tool in spectral view.
*   **Frequency Space Editing**: Cut/copy/paste specific frequency ranges without affecting time.

### 2.2 Advanced Analysis Tools
**Current State**: Plot Spectrum exists but is static.
**Goal**: Real-time, interactive analysis.
*   **Phase Analysis Tool**: Lissajous/Phase meter for stereo imaging checks.
*   **3D Spectral Decay**: Waterfall plot for reverb/resonance analysis.
*   **Loudness Radar**: Real-time loudness monitoring (LUFS) for broadcast compliance.

### 2.3 Noise Reduction Suite
**Current State**: "Noise Reduction" effect is decent but dated.
**Goal**: State-of-the-art restoration.
*   **Adaptive Noise Reduction**: Real-time noise floor learning (no noise profile step needed).
*   **DeHummer / DeClicker / DeEsser**: Specialized, knob-based real-time effects.
*   **Sound Remover**: "Sound Print" based removal (remove a siren from a music track).

## Phase 3: The "Pro" Production Features
*Focus: Creative tools for music production and post-production.*

### 3.1 Loop-Based Composition (Loopology)
**Current State**: Basic looping.
**Goal**: Acid-style loop handling.
*   **Beat Detection**: Automatic BPM detection for imported clips.
*   **Elastic Audio**: Real-time time-stretching to match project tempo (already partially in Audacity, needs refinement).
*   **Groove Quantize**: Align audio transients to a grid.

### 3.2 Post-Production Tools
**Current State**: Basic video import.
**Goal**: Video scoring and ADR support.
*   **Video Preview Window**: A floating window to watch video while editing audio.
*   **Automatic Speech Alignment**: Align dubbing (ADR) audio to the original production audio automatically.
*   **Strip Silence**: Automatically remove silence from long recordings (podcast/dialogue editing).

## Phase 4: Modernization & Ecosystem
*Focus: Bringing Audacity into the AI and Cloud era.*

### 4.1 AI & Machine Learning
*   **Music Remix**: Retime songs to specific durations automatically.
*   **Auto-Ducking (AI)**: "Essential Sound" style auto-ducking that intelligently lowers music during speech.
*   **Vocal Isolation**: High-quality stem separation (Music/Vocals/Drums).

### 4.2 Usability & Customization
*   **Workspaces**: Save/load UI layouts (e.g., "Radio", "Music", "Mastering").
*   **Batch Processing 2.0**: Visual flow-chart style batch processor.
*   **Scripting**: Enhanced Python API for deep automation.

## Prioritization Strategy

1.  **Workflow First**: Users migrate for *workflow*. Prioritize **Non-destructive editing** and **Real-time Effects Rack** (Phase 1).
2.  **Restoration Second**: Audacity is heavily used for cleanup. **Spectral Spot Healing** and **Adaptive Noise Reduction** (Phase 2) are high-value targets.
3.  **Mixing Third**: Pro mixing features (Phase 1.3) attract music producers.
